Hotels Coding Test

This is a project that I created as part of the process of obtaining employment at Orbitz.

The requirements for the project were as follows:
"Create an iOS application that does the following:

- Reads in the hotels.json file attached with this assignment.
- Displays a UITabBarController with two options, List and Map.
- The List view should render the hotels in a scrollable list using a UITableView. Each item in the list should display the hotel’s name and thumbnail image.
- The List view should also provide a mechanism for sorting the Hotels by 3 separate criteria:
  - Lowest to highest total rate
  - Distance from current location from closest to furthest
  - Star rating from highest to lowest, using hotel name as a secondary sort key
- The Map view should render the hotels on a UIMapView in the form of map pins. Add a custom map annovation view for the selected pin displaying the hotel’s name and thumbnail image.
- Feel free to use any additional libraries, as well as Swift or Objective-C"

(Note: this is still a WIP)
